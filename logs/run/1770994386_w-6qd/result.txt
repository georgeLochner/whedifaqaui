Done.

**Fix**: In `extract_citations()` at `backend/app/services/chat.py:171-178`, replaced the `break`-on-first-`video_id`-match with closest-timestamp matching. For each citation, the code now iterates all search results for that video and picks the one whose `start_time` is nearest to the cited timestamp.

**Verification**: Asked "What new features were added to Backdrop CMS 1.24?" — the 4 citations at timestamps 3:06, 5:48, 7:55, and 6:34 each show distinct, correct transcript text corresponding to their respective segments.
