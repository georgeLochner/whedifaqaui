Task complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Created 7 features for Phase 1** with comprehensive descriptions and dependency chain:

| # | Feature ID | Title | Stories | Depends On |
|---|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 | w-6nz | Project Scaffolding & Infrastructure | (foundation) | — |
| 2 | w-a4r | Video Upload & Storage | V1, V3 | w-6nz |
| 3 | w-csa | Video Processing Pipeline | V2, C1, P1-transcode | w-a4r |
| 4 | w-q64 | Search & Indexing | S1, S3-backend | w-csa |
| 5 | w-7bx | Video Playback & Transcript UI | P1, P2, P3 | w-csa |
| 6 | w-wh0 | Video Library & Search UI | M1, S1-UI, S3-UI | w-q64 + w-7bx |
| 7 | w-02w | Phase 1 Regression Testing | (quality gate) | w-wh0 |

Each feature has a "Plan tasks" child task. Features 4 and 5 can execute in parallel after Feature 3. Only w-6nz and w-6nz.1 are currently ready — everything else is properly blocked.
