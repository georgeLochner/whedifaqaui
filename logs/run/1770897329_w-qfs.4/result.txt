**`backend/app/api/routes/chat.py`** — POST `/api/chat` endpoint that:
- Accepts `ChatRequest` (message + optional conversation_id)
- Delegates to `handle_chat_message()` from the chat service
- Returns `ChatResponse` with message, conversation_id, and citations
- Handles `ClaudeError` → HTTP 500, `TimeoutExpired` → HTTP 504
