Task w-dnx.5 is complete. Changes made:

- **`frontend/src/components/workspace/ConversationPanel.tsx`** — Added `onCitationsReceived` prop that fires when new assistant messages arrive with citations
- **`frontend/src/pages/WorkspacePage.tsx`** — Wired `useWorkspace` hook, replaced stub panels with real `ResultsPanel` and `ContentPane`, connected citation click → add result + select, and chat response → results accumulation
- **`frontend/src/__tests__/components/workspace/ResultsPanel.integration.test.tsx`** — 7 integration tests covering S8-I01, S8-I02, S9-I01, S9-I02, S9-I03
- **`frontend/src/__tests__/pages/WorkspacePage.test.tsx`** — Updated to mock new dependencies, all 7 existing tests still pass

All 14 tests pass across both test files plus 5 existing ConversationPanel tests unaffected. This unblocks w-dnx.6 (E2E verification).
