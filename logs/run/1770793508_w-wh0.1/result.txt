2. **w-wh0.3**: Create VideoCard, VideoList, Navigation, and Layout components with tests (M1-F02, M1-F03, M1-F04, M1-F05)
3. **w-wh0.4**: Create LibraryPage and wire up Layout/Navigation in App (M1-F01)
4. **w-wh0.5**: Create SearchBar, SearchResults components and update SearchPage with tests (S1-F01, S1-F02, S1-F03, S3-F01, S3-F02)
5. **w-wh0.6**: E2E verification (all 10 frontend test IDs + E2E-01 steps 7-12, E2E-03, E2E-04)
