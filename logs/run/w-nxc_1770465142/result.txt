Task w-nxc is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Created 7 features for Phase 1** with comprehensive descriptions and sequential dependencies:

| # | Feature | ID | Stories |
|---|---------|-----|---------|
| 1 | Project Scaffolding & Infrastructure | w-7ib | Foundation (models, Docker, config) |
| 2 | Video Upload & Storage | w-zqu | V1, V3 (partial) |
| 3 | Video Processing Pipeline | w-pi2 | V2, V3, C1, P1 (partial) |
| 4 | Search & Indexing | w-wqm | S1, S3 (backend) |
| 5 | Video Playback & Transcript UI | w-jjb | P1, P2, P3 |
| 6 | Library & Search UI | w-ych | M1, S1/S3 (frontend), V3 (frontend) |
| 7 | Phase 1 Regression Testing | w-3vg | Quality gate (R1-01 through R1-10) |

Each feature has a "Plan tasks" child task. Dependencies ensure sequential execution: Feature 1's plan task is ready immediately, and each subsequent plan task unblocks only after the previous feature is closed.
