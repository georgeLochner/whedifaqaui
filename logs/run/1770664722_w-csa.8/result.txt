Task w-csa.8 is complete. Summary of what was done:

1. **Ran all automated tests** - 78 backend tests + 16 frontend tests, all passing
2. **Verified 19/19 test IDs** exist and pass (10 unit + 9 integration)
3. **Executed the E2E pipeline** - uploaded `test_meeting_primary.mkv`, pipeline ran through all stages (uploaded → processing → transcribing → chunking → indexing → ready)
4. **Fixed a PyTorch 2.6+ compatibility bug** - `torch.load` defaults to `weights_only=True` in PyTorch 2.6+, which broke pyannote model loading. Added `_patch_torch_load()` to `transcription.py`
5. **Verified transcription quality** against ground truth: 90% content accuracy, 100% key terms, 97% overall quality score
6. **No regressions** - full test suite passes cleanly
