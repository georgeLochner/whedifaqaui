Task w-wh0.6 complete. Summary:

- **All 200 tests pass** (133 backend + 67 frontend), zero regressions
- **All 10 required test IDs** verified present and passing
- **All 3 E2E scenarios** verified through browser (search flow, library filtering, no-results)
- **1 bug fixed**: `VideoCard` crashed when `video.participants` was `null` from the API — added null guard and updated the `Video` TypeScript type to `string[] | null`
- **Parent feature w-wh0** also closed as all quality gates are satisfied
