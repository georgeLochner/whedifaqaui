Task w-dtt.1 is complete. I created a single implementation task (w-dtt.2: "Execute Phase 2 regression tests") that will:

1. Add Phase 2 regression tests (R2-01 through R2-07) to `docs/testing/regression-pack.md`
2. Establish the data baseline per the phase2 test spec
3. Execute all Phase 1 (R1-01 to R1-11) and Phase 2 (R2-01 to R2-07) regression tests
4. Execute E2E-P2-01 through E2E-P2-07 via Playwright MCP
5. Report PASS/FAIL for each test and create blocking bugs for any failures
