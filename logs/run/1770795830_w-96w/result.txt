Done. Here's what was fixed:

**w-96w: Speaker diarization fails: HF_TOKEN not configured**

Added `HF_TOKEN` configuration plumbing to three files:
- **`.env`** — empty placeholder for the actual token value
- **`.env.example`** — with comments linking to HuggingFace token creation and pyannote license pages
- **`docker-compose.yml`** — passed to both `backend` (line 74) and `worker` (line 104) via `${HF_TOKEN:-}`

The code in `transcription.py` already correctly reads `HF_TOKEN` from the environment and conditionally runs the pyannote diarization pipeline. The missing piece was the configuration wiring.

**Note:** The R1-11 regression test (multi-speaker diarization) will only pass once a valid HuggingFace token is added to `.env` — this requires a HuggingFace account with accepted pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 license.
