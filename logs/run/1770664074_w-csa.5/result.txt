Task **w-csa.5** is complete. Here's what was done:

**Created files:**
- `backend/app/tasks/chunking.py` — `chunk_segments` Celery task that loads transcript segments from DB, runs `semantic_chunk()`, replaces initial segments with final chunks, then chains to `index_segments`
- `backend/app/tasks/indexing.py` — `index_segments` Celery task that generates embeddings via `generate_embeddings()`, creates the OpenSearch `segments_index` with KNN mapping (768-dim, cosinesimil, HNSW), bulk indexes all segments, marks them as indexed, and sets video status to READY

**Modified files:**
- `backend/app/tasks/celery_app.py` — Replaced `autodiscover_tasks` with explicit `include` list for all 5 task modules, ensuring reliable task registration

**Pipeline chain:** `process_video` → `transcribe_video` → `chunk_segments` → `index_segments`, with each task chaining to the next and error handling setting status to ERROR throughout.
