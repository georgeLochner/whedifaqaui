## E2E Verification Report

### Automated Tests
- Backend unit tests: **27 passed**, 0 failed
- Backend integration tests: **11 passed**, 0 failed
- Frontend tests: **16 passed**, 0 failed

### Bug Found & Fixed
- **VITE_API_URL** in `docker-compose.yml` was `http://localhost:8000` (missing `/api` prefix), causing browser uploads to POST to `http://localhost:8000/videos` instead of `http://localhost:8000/api/videos` (404). Fixed to `http://localhost:8000/api`.

### E2E Scenarios

  - Step 1: Navigate to upload page - PASS (all form fields visible)
  - Step 2: Fill form with title, date, participants, notes, MKV file - PASS
  - Step 3: Submit form - PASS (upload completes successfully after fix)
  - Step 4: Observe status badge - PASS (shows "uploaded")
  - Step 5: Status endpoint returns current status - PASS (`{"status": "uploaded"}`)
- **E2E-05: Error handling - PASS (upload-side)**
  - Non-MKV files rejected with 400: PASS
  - File input restricted to .mkv (client-side): PASS
  - Corrupted .mkv accepted for upload (error detection is processing pipeline scope): PASS
