Task w-dnx.4 is complete. Created:

- **`frontend/src/components/workspace/ContentPane.tsx`** — Right panel with three modes: empty state placeholder, video mode (reusing Phase 1 VideoPlayer + TranscriptPanel with seek-to-timestamp and transcript sync), and document mode (title + download button placeholder)
- **`frontend/src/__tests__/components/workspace/ContentPane.test.tsx`** — 9 unit tests covering S9-F01 through S9-F07

All 9 tests pass. This unblocks w-dnx.5 (Wire WorkspacePage).
