Task complete. Here's what was done:

**w-6nz.5: Create SQLAlchemy models (Video, Transcript, Segment)**

Created 3 model files + updated `__init__.py`:

- **`backend/app/models/video.py`** — Video model with 13 columns (UUID PK, title, file_path, status with server default, participants ARRAY, recording_date, timestamps) and 2 indexes (`idx_videos_status`, `idx_videos_recording_date`)
- **`backend/app/models/transcript.py`** — Transcript model with 6 columns, FK to `videos.id` with CASCADE delete, UniqueConstraint on `video_id`
- **`backend/app/models/segment.py`** — Segment model with 10 columns, FKs to both `transcripts.id` and `videos.id` with CASCADE, and 3 indexes including composite `idx_segments_time`
- **`backend/app/models/__init__.py`** — Exports all three models

Verification passed: `from app.models import Video, Transcript, Segment` succeeds in the container.
