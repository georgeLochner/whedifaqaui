Task w-6nz.1 is complete. I created 9 tasks (8 implementation + 1 E2E verification) for the Project Scaffolding & Infrastructure feature, set up a linear dependency chain, and closed the planning task. The first implementation task (w-6nz.2: Create Docker Compose and environment config) is now unblocked and ready for work.
