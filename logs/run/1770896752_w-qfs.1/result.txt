Task w-qfs.1 is complete. I created 4 implementation tasks for the Chat API & Context Pipeline feature:

1. **w-qfs.2** — Create Chat schemas with unit tests (ChatRequest, ChatResponse, Citation)
2. **w-qfs.3** — Implement Chat service with unit tests (context file prep, citation extraction, orchestration)
3. **w-qfs.4** — Create Chat API endpoint with integration tests (POST /api/chat, router registration)
4. **w-qfs.5** — E2E verify Chat API & Context Pipeline (run all tests, verify full flow)

Dependencies are chained: w-qfs.2 → w-qfs.3 → w-qfs.4 → w-qfs.5, with w-qfs.2 unblocked now that the planning task is closed.
