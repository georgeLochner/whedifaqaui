Task w-a4r.6 is complete. Here's a summary:

**Files created:**
- `frontend/src/api/videos.ts` — API client with `uploadVideo` (multipart/form-data + progress callback), `getVideos`, `getVideo`, `getVideoStatus`
- `frontend/src/components/upload/UploadForm.tsx` — Form with file input (.mkv only), title, date, participants, notes, client-side validation, all `data-testid` attributes
- `frontend/src/components/upload/UploadProgress.tsx` — Progress bar shown during upload
- `frontend/src/components/common/StatusBadge.tsx` — Color-coded badge (gray/yellow/blue/green/red per status)

**Files modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/UploadPage.tsx` — Replaced placeholder with working page that wires form + progress + status polling (every 5s, stops at ready/error)

**Verification:** TypeScript build succeeds, page renders correctly at localhost:3000/upload with all fields visible.
