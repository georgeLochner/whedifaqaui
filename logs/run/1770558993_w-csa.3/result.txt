Task w-csa.3 is complete. Created two files:

- **`backend/app/services/transcription.py`** - WhisperX integration with `load_whisperx_model` (cached), `transcribe_audio` (full transcribe→align→diarize workflow), `parse_whisperx_output` (normalized segments with speaker label defaults), `calculate_word_count`
- **`backend/app/tasks/transcription.py`** - `transcribe_video` Celery task that runs WhisperX, creates Transcript + Segment DB records, saves JSON to `/data/transcripts/`, cleans up audio WAV, and chains to chunking task

All 42 existing tests pass with no regressions.
