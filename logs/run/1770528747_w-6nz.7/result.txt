Task w-6nz.7 is complete. Here's what was done:

**Already existed** (from previous agents):
- `main.py` - FastAPI app with CORS, health endpoint, router mounting
- `celery_app.py` - Celery config with Redis broker
- `tasks/ping.py` - Health check task
- `api/routes/health.py` - Health endpoint checking postgres, opensearch, redis
- All `__init__.py` package files

**Created in this session:**
- `backend/app/api/deps.py` - Re-exports `get_db` for API dependency injection
- `backend/app/schemas/video.py` - `VideoStatus` enum with all 7 values (uploaded, processing, transcribing, chunking, indexing, ready, error)
- `backend/tests/unit/test_video.py` - V3-U01 test verifying enum completeness

**Verified:**
- Health endpoint returns `{"status": "ok"}` with all services connected
- All 4 tests pass (3 new + 1 existing)
- No regressions
