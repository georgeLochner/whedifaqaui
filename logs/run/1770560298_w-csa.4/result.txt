Task **w-csa.4** is complete. Summary of what was done:

- **Fixed** unused `import math` in `embedding.py` left by previous agent
- **Verified** both services import and function correctly in Docker:
  - `embedding.py`: BGE model loads, produces 768-dim vectors, cosine similarity works (self-sim=1.0, zero-vec=0.0)
  - `chunking.py`: Empty/single/multi-segment chunking all work, speaker attribution and timestamp ordering validated
- **Installed** `sentence-transformers` and `numpy` in both backend and worker containers
- **Committed** all changes
