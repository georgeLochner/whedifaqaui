Task w-a4r.4 is complete.

Created:
- **`backend/app/api/routes/videos.py`** - POST /api/videos (multipart upload with metadata), GET /api/videos (paginated list), GET /api/videos/{id} (detail), GET /api/videos/{id}/status (polling)
- **`backend/app/main.py`** - Mounted videos router at /api prefix

Verified: GET /api/videos returns `{"videos": [], "total": 0}`, health endpoint still works.
