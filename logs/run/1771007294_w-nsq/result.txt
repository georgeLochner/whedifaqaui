Done. Here's a summary of the fix:

**Bug**: `_has_keyword_overlap` checked if query keywords appeared in the **combined text** of all search results. If even one result contained a keyword, all results passed — including irrelevant ones.

**Fix**: Renamed to `_filter_by_keyword_overlap` and changed it from a batch boolean check to a per-result filter. Each individual search result must contain at least one query keyword to be kept. For "who contracted covid", this reduces results from 4 to 1 (only the segment mentioning COVID).

**Verification**: Backend filtering confirmed working — only 1 segment (the one mentioning Tim Erickson recovering from COVID) passes. The remaining answer-quality issue (Claude answering about Backdrop features instead of COVID despite correct context) is a prompt-level problem tracked by the downstream task w-cfr.

**Tests**: All new and updated tests pass (29/30, with 1 pre-existing unrelated failure).
