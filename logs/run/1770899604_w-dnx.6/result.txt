Task w-dnx.6 is complete. Summary of what was done:

1. **Ran all 42 specified tests** — all passed
2. **Verified all 21 test IDs** are covered by actual test implementations
3. **Found and fixed a bug**: `useWorkspace` and `useChat` hooks used plain `useState` so results and conversation history were lost on navigation. Added `sessionStorage` persistence to both hooks.
4. **Executed all 3 E2E scenarios** (E2E-P2-01, E2E-P2-02, E2E-P2-05) through the browser — all passed after the fix
5. **Ran full regression suite**: 150 frontend tests + 205 backend tests — all passing
6. **Closed both w-dnx.6 (task) and w-dnx (feature)**
