## E2E Verification Report

### Automated Tests
- Backend unit tests: **83 passed**, 0 failed
- Backend integration tests: **49 passed**, 0 failed
- Frontend tests: **38 passed**, 0 failed (8 test files)

### E2E Scenarios
- **E2E-02** (Video playback with transcript sync): **PASS**
  - Step 1-2: Navigate to video page - PASS (Library not built yet; navigated directly to `/videos/{id}`)
  - Step 3: Verify player loads - PASS (Video.js player renders with Play button)
  - Step 4: Play video - PASS (Pause, Mute, Volume, Progress Bar, Fullscreen controls visible)
  - Step 5: Transcript highlighting updates - PASS (segment has `active` class + `bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500`)
  - Step 6: Click transcript segment - PASS (video seeks back to start_time=0.031)
  - Step 7: Verify video seeks - PASS (remaining time jumped from -1:03 to -1:21)
  - Step 8: URL updates with ?t= - PASS (URL became `?t=0.031`)
  - Step 9-10: Deep-link with ?t=45 - PASS (player.currentTime confirmed at 45 seconds)
  - Speaker labels: PASS ("SPEAKER_00:" prefix visible)

### Bugs Found & Fixed
1. **VideoPlayer not rendering in browser** - React StrictMode double-mount caused Video.js disposal to remove the video element permanently. Fixed by using the Video.js recommended imperative element creation pattern (`document.createElement('video-js')` + `!playerRef.current` guard).
2. **Transcript click didn't seek video** - `handleSegmentClick` only updated React state and URL, but had no connection to `player.currentTime()`. Fixed by adding `seekTo` prop to VideoPlayer.

### Parent Feature Cross-Check
- Test IDs: **17/17 covered**
- E2E scenarios: **1/1 executed** (E2E-01 steps 10-12 require w-wh0 Library feature)
- Quality Gate: **ALL satisfied**

### Regressions
- Full backend test suite: **133 passed** - PASS
- Full frontend test suite: **38 passed** - PASS
- Health endpoint: **PASS** (postgres connected, opensearch green, redis connected)
