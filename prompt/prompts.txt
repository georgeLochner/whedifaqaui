This is a brainstorming session about a new project. We are not writing any code. We are simply going to define user requirements but you should ultrathink about this project. 
The inspiration for this project was my experience during the handover of a complex technical project. The current team of developers needed to hand over the project to a new team. This involved a lot of technical meetings during which there where explanations and demonstrations of various parts of the system. The system was mostly undocumentated so all the knowledge was exchanged during these presentations. This resulted in many hours of video taped meetings. So the challenge after the original team had departed was to find the specific sections of videos where particular parts of the system or scenarios were discussed from among the many hours of recordings. The goal of the development which we will plan here is to create a system which will ingest videos, transcribe them and then index the content in a way that we can search for content using natural language queries. The system must then identify specific videos and timestamps where relevant information can be found as well as provide summary answers. 
We must define all the user requirements and interaction mechanisms and generate a list of user stories that our project must satisfy. Only once these are defined will we look at technical approaches required to implement the project. Ask any questions that require clarification.




Before we begin any kind of implementation we need to create a high level architectural plan. So put your architect hat on. For this endevour we will consider the project in its entirety as documented. We must now determine the high level structure and identify which components
  are required and where they will be created in the project structure. We do not neccesraily have to define specific file names but rather the overall folder structure so that we basically which components are required and where they will live but we still leave some
  flexibility regarding the actual detail implementation for later. So we are looking for a structural layer definition and a high level specification of the components such are modules or services that are required. 

--------------------------
prior to starting phase 1 I want to introduce a "phase 0" which must cover the setup of the environment. This should include: 
* running servers that just return health check status, without any functionality implemented, 
* docker images for dependencies such as db installed and tested for availability
* docker compose environemnt configured
* all python/npm dependencies installed and virtual env prepared

Can you think of any other preparation activities that should be included. We want to get the environment in a state that is ready for code implementation
--------------------------------------
Our goal is to implement phase 0 to 3. However the final and most critical step before implementation can start is that we need to analyse each phase individually and define the testing criteria that we will use to determine that the     
  phase is succesfully implemented. Phase 0 is a bit different since it involves environment setup. Analyse @docs/implementation/phase0.md and determine whether the verification steps are adequate to confirm that the environment is         
  ready, or suggest additional tests and verifications

Our goal is to implement phase 1 to 3. However the final and most critical step before implementation can start is that we need to analyse each phase individually and define the testing criteria that we will use to determine that the     
  phase is succesfully implemented. Critically we need to define end to end test and create test resources such that we can test the system with known inputs and expected outputs. A key aspect of verificaiton in general is also that agents should use playwright mcp to capture screenshots. Playwright is not currently enabled in this project but it will be available when implementation commences. As such we need to plan how verification should be accomplished, including required screenshots. Let us analyse phase 1 including user stories and then define the required tests which should include a combination of functional test as well as end to end tests.
