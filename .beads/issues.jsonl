Users can watch processed videos, see the transcript highlighted in sync with playback, click transcript segments to seek the video, and share deep links to specific timestamps via URL parameters.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- P1: Embedded video player with standard controls\n- P2: Timestamp navigation (clickable timestamps, URL deep-linking)\n- P3: Synchronized transcript display (current segment highlighted, click to seek)\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/api/routes/playback.py` - GET /videos/{id}/stream (video file serving with Range request support), GET /videos/{id}/transcript (transcript segments with timestamps and speakers)\n- `backend/app/schemas/transcript.py` - TranscriptResponse, SegmentResponse Pydantic schemas\n- `frontend/src/pages/VideoPage.tsx` - Video playback page: player + transcript panel side-by-side, URL timestamp parameter handling (?t=seconds)\n- `frontend/src/components/video/VideoPlayer.tsx` - HTML5 video player using Video.js with standard controls (play, pause, seek, volume), src pointing to /videos/{id}/stream\n- `frontend/src/components/video/TranscriptPanel.tsx` - Scrollable transcript with segments, current segment highlighted, click to seek, speaker labels, auto-scroll during playback\n- `frontend/src/components/video/TimestampLink.tsx` - Clickable timestamp component (formats seconds to MM:SS, onClick seeks player)\n- `frontend/src/hooks/useVideoPlayer.ts` - Custom hook for player state management (currentTime, playing, seek function)\n- `frontend/src/hooks/useTranscriptSync.ts` - Custom hook for transcript synchronization (determines active segment based on currentTime)\n- `frontend/src/types/transcript.ts` - Transcript and Segment TypeScript types\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_playback_api.py` - Playback API tests\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/main.py` - Mount playback router\n- `backend/app/api/routes/__init__.py` - Export playback router\n- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Import and use VideoPage component\n- `frontend/src/api/videos.ts` - Add getTranscript() API function\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature: Project Scaffolding \u0026 Infrastructure (w-6nz) must be complete\n- Feature: Video Upload \u0026 Storage (w-a4r) must be complete (video records exist)\n- Feature: Video Processing Pipeline (w-csa) must be complete (MP4 transcoded, transcript generated)\n- Video.js 8.6.x for the player component\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Video served as MP4 from /data/videos/processed/{id}.mp4 via streaming endpoint\n- Range request support (HTTP 206) for seek functionality\n- Transcript endpoint returns array of segments with: id, start_time, end_time, text, speaker\n- Timestamp format: seconds displayed as MM:SS (e.g., 125s → \"2:05\")\n- URL deep-linking: /videos/{id}?t=125 auto-seeks to 2:05 on page load\n- Transcript auto-scrolls to keep active segment visible during playback\n- Active segment determined by: segment.start_time \u003c= currentTime \u003c segment.end_time\n- Video.js player wrapped in React component with ref for programmatic control\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Stream endpoint: use FileResponse or StreamingResponse with media_type=\"video/mp4\"\n- Support Range headers for partial content (HTTP 206) - critical for seek\n- Transcript endpoint queries segments table ordered by start_time\n- VideoPlayer component: initialize Video.js on mount, destroy on unmount\n- TranscriptPanel: listen to player timeupdate events, find active segment, apply 'active' CSS class\n- TimestampLink: format seconds with Math.floor(s/60) + \":\" + pad(s%60)\n- URL timestamp: read ?t= from useSearchParams, seek player on mount\n- When user clicks transcript segment, call player.currentTime(segment.start_time)\n- Speaker labels displayed as \"SPEAKER_00:\" prefix on each segment\n- Use data-testid attributes for Playwright testing (see test spec for exact IDs)\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: P1 (Embedded Video Player), P2 (Timestamp Navigation), P3 (Synchronized Transcript)\n\n### Unit Tests (Backend)\n- P1-U01: test_video_transcode_to_mp4 -

The pipeline runs as a chain of Celery tasks.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- V2: Automatic transcription with timestamps and speaker diarization\n- V3: Processing status indicators (pipeline-side: status transitions during processing)\n- C1: Semantic chunking (transcript segmented into semantic chunks for indexing)\n- P1: Embedded video player (prerequisite: MP4 transcoding)\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/services/ffmpeg.py` - FFmpeg operations: remux/transcode MKV→MP4, extract audio WAV, generate thumbnail\n- `backend/app/services/transcription.py` - WhisperX integration: model loading, transcription + speaker diarization, output parsing\n- `backend/app/services/chunking.py` - Semantic chunking: embedding-based boundary detection, chunk creation with speaker labels\n- `backend/app/services/embedding.py` - BGE model wrapper (BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5): batch embedding generation, 768-dim vectors\n- `backend/app/tasks/video_processing.py` - Celery task: FFmpeg remux/transcode, thumbnail, audio extraction; updates status to 'processing'\n- `backend/app/tasks/transcription.py` - Celery task: WhisperX transcription + diarization → JSON output, creates transcript + initial segments in DB; updates status to 'transcribing'\n- `backend/app/tasks/chunking.py` - Celery task: semantic chunking → segments in DB with speaker labels; updates status to 'chunking'\n- `backend/app/tasks/indexing.py` - Celery task: generate embeddings, bulk index segments to OpenSearch; updates status to 'indexing' then 'ready'\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_transcription.py` - WhisperX output parsing tests\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_chunking.py` - Semantic chunking logic tests\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_embedding.py` - Embedding generation tests\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_processing_pipeline.py` - Full pipeline integration tests\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/tasks/celery_app.py` - Register all task modules\n- `backend/app/services/video.py` - Add status update methods\n- `backend/app/api/routes/videos.py` - Ensure upload endpoint dispatches the processing chain\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature: Project Scaffolding \u0026 Infrastructure (w-6nz) must be complete\n- Feature: Video Upload \u0026 Storage (w-a4r) must be complete (upload creates DB record)\n- FFmpeg installed in Docker container\n- WhisperX + pyannote.audio for transcription/diarization\n- sentence-transformers for BGE embeddings\n- HuggingFace token for pyannote models (env var)\n- CUDA optional but recommended for performance\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Pipeline stages chained as Celery tasks: video_processing → transcription → chunking → indexing\n- Each stage updates video status in PostgreSQL (processing → transcribing → chunking → indexing → ready)\n- On any error, status set to 'error' with error_message populated\n- WhisperX provides both transcription AND speaker labels (SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc.)\n- Transcript JSON saved to /data/transcripts/{video_id}.json for LLM verification\n- Semantic chunking uses embedding cosine similarity to detect topic boundaries\n- Chunking parameters from system_settings: similarity_threshold=0.5, min_chunk_tokens=100, max_chunk_tokens=500\n- BGE model: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5, 768-dimensional embeddings\n- OpenSearch indexing: bulk API with segment text, embedding, metadata\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- FFmpeg remux: if source is MKV with H.264+AAC, remux to MP4 (fast copy). Otherwise, transcode.\n- Audio extraction: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 output.wav\n- Thumbnail: extract frame at 10% of duration, resize to 320x180\n- WhisperX workflow: load model → transcribe → align → diarize → merge segments\n- Speaker labels format: \"SPEAKER_00\", \"SPEAKER_01\", etc. from pyannote\n- Transcript saved as JSON with segments[{start, end, text, speaker}]\n- Semantic chunking algorithm:\n  1. Compute sentence-level embeddings\n  2. Calculate cosine similarity between consecutive sentences\n  3. Split at points where similarity drops below threshold\n  4. Merge small chunks, split large chunks\n  5. Preserve speaker attribution per chunk\n- OpenSearch document format: {id, video_id, video_title, transcript_id, text, embedding, start_time, end_time, speaker, recording_date, created_at}\n- Error handling: wrap each stage in try/except, set video status='error' with descriptive message\n- Temporary audio files cleaned up after transcription\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: V2 (Automatic Transcription), V3 (Processing Status) - pipeline-side, C1 (Semantic Chunking), P1 (partially - transcode)\n\n### Unit Tests\n- V2-U01: test_whisperx_output_parsing - Parse WhisperX JSON output correctly\n- V2-U02: test_segment_timestamp_extraction - Start/end times as floats in seconds\n- V2-U03: test_speaker_label_extraction - \"SPEAKER_00\" format preserved\n- V2-U04: test_word_count_calculation - Word count matches expected\n- C1-U01: test_chunk_size_limits - Chunks within 50-500 words\n- C1-U02: test_chunk_preserves_speaker - Speaker label retained per chunk\n- C1-U03: test_chunk_timestamps_valid - start_time \u003c end_time for each chunk\n- C1-U04: test_semantic_boundary_detection - Splits at natural topic breaks\n- P1-U01: test_video_transcode_to_mp4 - FFmpeg produces valid MP4\n- P1-U02: test_processed_path_stored - processed_path updated in DB\n\n### Integration Tests\n- V2-I01: test_transcription_creates_transcript_record - Transcript row created with correct video_id\n- V2-I02: test_transcription_creates_segments - Segment count matches WhisperX output\n- V2-I03: test_audio_extraction - WAV extracted from MKV successfully\n- V2-I04: test_transcription_with_test_video - Full pipeline with test_meeting_primary.mkv\n- V2-I05: test_thumbnail_generated - Thumbnail file exists at thumbnail_path\n- V3-I01: test_status_updates_during_processing - Status progresses through all stages\n- C1-I01: test_chunking_creates_segments - Segments stored in DB with count \u003e 0\n- C1-I02: test_chunks_indexed_to_opensearch - OpenSearch doc count matches DB\n- C1-I03: test_chunk_embeddings_generated - 768-dim vector per segment\n\n### E2E Scenarios (LLM Verified)\n- V2-E01: test_transcription_content_accuracy - Content ≥85% semantic match with ground truth\n- V2-E02: test_speaker_diarization - Speaker count matches, transitions reasonable\n- V2-E03: test_timestamp_alignment - Boundaries within ±2s of ground truth\n- V2-E04: test_key_terms_preserved - ≥90% of key terms found\n- V2-E05: test_overall_transcription_quality - Weighted score ≥80%\n- E2E-06: Multi-speaker diarization test with test_meeting_long.mkv\n- E2E-07: LLM transcript verification\n\n### Quality Gate\nThis feature is NOT complete until:\n- All V2 unit tests pass (V2-U01 through V2-U04)\n- All C1 unit tests pass (C1-U01 through C1-U04)\n- P1-U01 and P1-U02 pass (transcode tests)\n- Integration tests for pipeline pass\n- Full pipeline completes for test_meeting_primary.mkv (status reaches 'ready')\n- Transcript JSON file generated at /data/transcripts/{video_id}.json\n- Segments created in DB with speaker labels\n- Status transitions correctly through all stages\n\n## Reference Documentation\n- docs/design/processing-pipeline.md - Pipeline stages and data flow\n- docs/design/data-model.md - segments table schema, OpenSearch segments_index mapping\n- docs/design/technology-stack.md - WhisperX, pyannote, sentence-transformers versions\n- docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md - V2, C1, P1 test specs, LLM verification\n- docs/reference/ - Extended specifications","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-07T14:26:09.278179767+02:00","updated_at":"2026-02-09T21:49:02.867808629+02:00","closed_at":"2026-02-09T21:49:02.867808629+02:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"w-csa","depends_on_id":"w-a4r","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-07T14:29:53.382024027+02:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"w-jjb","title":"Video Playback \u0026 Transcript UI","description":"# Feature: Video Playback \u0026 Transcript UI\n\n## Overview\nImplement the video playback experience: backend streaming endpoint (range request support), the VideoPage with embedded player (Video.js), synchronized transcript panel, and timestamp navigation (clickable timestamps + URL deep-linking). This is the primary video consumption interface where users watch videos and follow along with transcripts.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- P1: Embedded video player with standard controls\n- P2: Timestamp navigation (clickable timestamps, URL deep-linking)\n- P3: Synchronized transcript display with speaker labels\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/api/routes/playback.py` - GET /api/videos/{id}/stream (video file with range request support), GET /api/videos/{id}/transcript (transcript segments as JSON)\n- `frontend/src/pages/VideoPage.tsx` - Video page layout: player + transcript panel side-by-side\n- `frontend/src/components/video/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Video.js player component, plays from /api/videos/{id}/stream, supports seeking via prop\n- `frontend/src/components/video/TranscriptPanel.tsx` - Scrollable transcript: list of segments with speaker labels, highlights active segment, click to seek, auto-scrolls\n- `frontend/src/components/video/TimestampLink.tsx` - Clickable timestamp component: displays formatted time (MM:SS), onClick seeks video or navigates to /videos/{id}?t=seconds\n- `frontend/src/hooks/useVideoPlayer.ts` - Custom hook: manages player ref, currentTime state, seek function, handles ?t= URL parameter on mount\n- `frontend/src/hooks/useTranscriptSync.ts` - Custom hook: given currentTime and segments, returns activeSegmentIndex\n- `frontend/src/types/transcript.ts` - Transcript and Segment TypeScript types\n- `frontend/src/api/videos.ts` - (extend) getTranscript(videoId) API call\n- `frontend/src/__tests__/components/VideoPlayer.test.tsx` - Player render and source tests\n- `frontend/src/__tests__/components/TranscriptPanel.test.tsx` - Transcript rendering, highlighting, click tests\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_playback_api.py` - Stream and transcript endpoint tests\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/main.py` - Register playback routes\n- `backend/app/api/routes/__init__.py` - Export playback router\n- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Wire up VideoPage route at /videos/:id\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature 1 (Scaffolding): Base app, routing\n- Feature 2 (Upload): Video records exist, files on disk\n- Feature 3 (Pipeline): Processed MP4 exists, transcript/segments in DB\n- External: video.js (npm), react-router-dom (for URL params)\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Video.js for player (not native \u003cvideo\u003e) - provides consistent cross-browser controls\n- Stream endpoint serves processed MP4 file (not original MKV) with Range request support (HTTP 206)\n- Content-Type: video/mp4\n- Transcript endpoint returns all segments for the video, ordered by start_time\n- Each segment in transcript response: {id, start_time, end_time, text, speaker}\n- Active segment determined by comparing currentTime to segment start/end times\n- Auto-scroll uses scrollIntoView with smooth behavior\n- URL deep-linking: /videos/{id}?t=123 → on mount, seek player to 123 seconds\n- TimestampLink formats seconds as MM:SS (e.g., 125 → \"2:05\", 3661 → \"61:01\")\n- Transcript panel shows speaker labels as prefix: \"SPEAKER_00: text here...\"\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Stream endpoint: use FileResponse with range support, or implement manually with StreamingResponse reading file chunks\n- Range request handling: parse Range header, return 206 with Content-Range\n- Video.js initialization: create player in useEffect, dispose on unmount\n- Video.js source: { src: '/api/videos/{id}/stream', type: 'video/mp4' }\n- Transcript sync: listen to 'timeupdate' event on video element, update currentTime state\n- Active segment: find segment where start_time \u003c= currentTime \u003c end_time\n- Click segment handler: call player.currentTime(segment.start_time)\n- URL timestamp: read searchParams.get('t') on mount, parse as float, seek\n- When user clicks timestamp on transcript, update URL with ?t= parameter (replaceState)\n- data-testid attributes: video-player, transcript-panel, transcript-segment, speaker-label, timestamp-link\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: P1: Embedded Video Player, P2: Timestamp Navigation, P3: Synchronized Transcript\n\n### Unit Tests (Backend)\n- P2-U01: test_timestamp_formatting - 125 → \"2:05\"\n- P2-U02: test_timestamp_parsing - \"2:05\" → 125\n\n### Integration Tests (Backend)\n- P1-I01: test_stream_endpoint_returns_video - GET /api/videos/{id}/stream returns bytes\n- P1-I02: test_stream_supports_range_requests - Range header → 206 Partial Content\n- P1-I03: test_stream_content_type - Content-Type is video/mp4\n- P3-I01: test_transcript_endpoint_returns_segments - GET /api/videos/{id}/transcript returns segments with timestamps\n- P3-I02: test_transcript_includes_speaker - Speaker labels in response\n\n### Frontend Unit Tests\n- P1-F01: test_video_player_renders - \u003cvideo\u003e element present\n- P1-F02: test_player_controls_visible - Play, pause, seek, volume visible\n- P1-F03: test_player_loads_source - src points to /api/videos/{id}/stream\n- P2-F01: test_timestamp_link_renders - \"1:23\" visible\n- P2-F02: test_timestamp_click_seeks_video - Click sets currentTime\n- P2-F03: test_url_with_timestamp - URL includes ?t=seconds\n- P2-F04: test_url_timestamp_auto_seeks - Page load with ?t seeks player\n- P3-F01: test_transcript_panel_renders - Segments listed\n- P3-F02: test_current_segment_highlighted - Active segment has CSS class\n- P3-F03: test_segment_click_seeks - Click segment → player seeks to start_time\n- P3-F04: test_auto_scroll_to_current - Active segment scrolled into view\n- P3-F05: test_speaker_labels_displayed - \"SPEAKER_00:\" prefix visible\n\n### E2E Scenarios\n- E2E-01 (steps 10-12): Click timestamp from search, player loads and seeks, transcript syncs\n- E2E-02: Full playback with transcript sync, click transcript to seek, URL deep-linking\n\n### Quality Gate\nThis feature is NOT complete until:\n- All P1-*, P2-*, P3-* tests pass\n- Video plays in browser from stream endpoint\n- Transcript highlights sync with playback\n- Clicking transcript segment seeks video\n- URL ?t= parameter works for deep-linking\n- Speaker labels displayed in transcript\n\n## Reference Documentation\n- docs/design/data-model.md - Transcript and Segment schemas\n- docs/design/processing-pipeline.md - Transcoded MP4 location\n- docs/design/technology-stack.md - Video.js version\n- docs/implementation/phase1.md - Playback endpoints, frontend components\n- docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md -

{"id":"w-pi2","title":"Video Processing Pipeline","description":"# Feature: Video Processing Pipeline\n\n## Overview\nImplement the async Celery pipeline that processes uploaded videos through four stages: FFmpeg transcode (MKV→MP4 + audio extraction + thumbnail), WhisperX transcription with speaker diarization, semantic chunking with embeddings, and status tracking through each stage. This is the core backend intelligence that transforms raw video into searchable content.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- V2: Automatic transcription with timestamps and speaker diarization\n- V3: Processing status indicators (status transitions through pipeline)\n- C1: Semantic chunking for search indexing\n- P1 (partial): FFmpeg transcode to MP4 for browser playback\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/services/ffmpeg.py` - FFmpeg operations: remux_to_mp4(input, output), extract_audio(input, output_wav), generate_thumbnail(input, output, timestamp=5)\n- `backend/app/services/transcription.py` - WhisperX integration: load_model(), transcribe(audio_path) → {segments with speaker labels, language, word_count}\n- `backend/app/services/chunking.py` - Semantic chunking: chunk_transcript(segments) → chunks with start/end times, text, speaker, using embedding similarity for boundary detection\n- `backend/app/services/embedding.py` - BGE model wrapper: load_model(), generate_embedding(text) → 768-dim vector, batch_embed(texts) → list of vectors\n- `backend/app/tasks/video_processing.py` - Celery task: remux/transcode MKV→MP4, extract audio WAV, generate thumbnail, update status to \"processing\"→\"transcribing\"\n- `backend/app/tasks/transcription.py` - Celery task: run WhisperX on audio, save transcript record, save WhisperX JSON to /data/transcripts/{video_id}.json, create segments in DB, update status to \"transcribing\"→\"chunking\"\n- `backend/app/tasks/chunking.py` - Celery task: read raw segments, apply semantic chunking, generate embeddings, save chunked segments to DB, update status to \"chunking\"→\"indexing\"\n- `backend/app/tasks/indexing.py` - Celery task: read segments from DB, bulk index to OpenSearch with embeddings, update status to \"indexing\"→\"ready\"\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_transcription.py` - WhisperX output parsing tests\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_chunking.py` - Semantic chunking logic tests\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_embedding.py` - Embedding generation tests\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_processing_pipeline.py` - Full pipeline integration tests\n- `scripts/prepare-test-data.sh` - Test data preparation script (download YouTube video, create test files)\n- `scripts/convert_srt_to_ground_truth.py` - SRT to ground truth JSON converter\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/tasks/celery_app.py` - Register task modules\n- `backend/app/models/video.py` - May need status transition helper method\n- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Add WHISPER_MODEL, WHISPER_DEVICE, HF_TOKEN settings\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature 1 (Scaffolding): Models, DB, Celery config\n- Feature 2 (Upload): Video records exist in DB, upload triggers pipeline\n- External: FFmpeg (system package), WhisperX (pip), pyannote.audio (pip + HuggingFace token), sentence-transformers (pip)\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Pipeline is a Celery chain: video_processing → transcription → chunking → indexing\n- Each task updates video status before starting its work\n- Error handling: if any task fails, set status to \"error\" with error_message\n- WhisperX provides both transcription AND speaker diarization (SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc.)\n- Semantic chunking uses embedding cosine similarity to detect topic boundaries (not fixed size)\n- Chunk size target: 50-500 words\n- Chunks split at sentence boundaries\n- Each chunk preserves speaker attribution\n- Embeddings use BGE model (BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) producing 768-dim vectors\n- Audio extracted as WAV temporarily, deleted after transcription\n- WhisperX JSON output saved to /data/transcripts/{video_id}.json for LLM verification\n- Thumbnail generated at 5-second mark of video\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Use ffmpeg-python library for FFmpeg operations\n- WhisperX API: whisperx.load_model(model, device), model.transcribe(audio), whisperx.load_align_model(), whisperx.align(), whisperx.DiarizationPipeline(), diarize_model(audio)\n- Semantic chunking algorithm: compute embeddings for each raw segment, calculate cosine similarity between consecutive segments, split where similarity drops below threshold\n- Tasks should be idempotent where possible (re-runnable on failure)\n- Status transitions must be atomic (use DB transaction)\n- Processing status flow: uploaded → processing → transcribing → chunking → indexing → ready\n- On error: status → error, error_message populated with descriptive text (not stack trace)\n- Celery task chaining: video_processing.s(video_id) | transcription.s() | chunking.s() | indexing.s()\n- For testing: mock WhisperX with deterministic output, test actual FFmpeg with small test video\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: V2: Automatic Transcription, V3: Processing Status, C1: Semantic Chunking\n\n### Unit Tests\n- V2-U01: test_whisperx_output_parsing -

Transcript row created with video_id\n- V2-I02: test_transcription_creates_segments - Segment count matches WhisperX output\n- V2-I03: test_audio_extraction - WAV extracted from MKV\n- V2-I04: test_transcription_with_test_video - Full pipeline with test video, transcript matches expected\n- V2-I05: test_thumbnail_generated - Thumbnail file exists at thumbnail_path\n- V3-I01: test_status_updates_during_processing - Status progresses through all stages\n- V3-I03: test_error_status_with_message - Error captured with descriptive message\n- C1-I01: test_chunking_creates_segments - Segments stored in DB\n- C1-I03: test_chunk_embeddings_generated - 768-dim vector per segment\n\n### E2E Tests (LLM-verified)\n- V2-E01: test_transcription_content_accuracy - Content accuracy ≥85% vs ground truth\n- V2-E02: test_speaker_diarization - Speaker count matches, transitions reasonable\n- V2-E03: test_timestamp_alignment - Boundaries within ±2s\n- V2-E04: test_key_terms_preserved - ≥90% key terms found\n- V2-E05: test_overall_transcription_quality - Weighted score ≥80%\n\n### E2E Scenarios\n- E2E-01 (steps 5-6): Wait for processing, LLM verification\n- E2E-05: Corrupted video error handling\n- E2E-06: Multi-speaker diarization with test_meeting_long.mkv\n- E2E-07: LLM transcript verification\n\n### Quality Gate\nThis feature is NOT complete until:\n- All V2-*, V3-*, C1-*, P1-U01/U02 tests pass\n- Full pipeline runs on test video: upload → processing → transcribing → chunking → ready\n- WhisperX produces segments with speaker labels\n- Semantic chunking produces reasonably sized chunks\n- Status transitions tracked correctly\n- Error handling works for corrupted video\n\n## Reference Documentation\n- docs/design/processing-pipeline.md -

This includes the OpenSearch index setup, hybrid query construction (BM25 keyword + kNN vector similarity), search API endpoint, and search result ranking. Users can search with free-text queries and get results with video references, timestamps, and text snippets.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- S1: Natural language search (hybrid: BM25 + vector)\n- S3: Search results link directly to video timestamps (backend: results include video_id, start_time)\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/services/search.py` -

{"id":"w-wh0","title":"Video Library \u0026 Search UI","description":"# Feature: Video Library \u0026 Search UI\n\n## Overview\nImplement the video library page (home/landing page) with filterable/sortable video list, and the search page with query input and results display. The library shows all uploaded videos as cards with thumbnails, status badges, and metadata. The search page lets users enter natural language queries and displays results with video titles, text snippets, timestamps, and navigation links.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- M1: Video library view with status/filtering\n- S1: Natural language search (frontend: search bar, loading state, result display)\n- S3: Search results link directly to video timestamps (frontend: clickable timestamp links in results)\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `frontend/src/pages/LibraryPage.tsx` - Video library page: grid of video cards, filter by status, sort by date, empty state\n- `frontend/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx` - Search page: search bar, loading spinner, results list, no-results message\n- `frontend/src/components/library/VideoCard.tsx` - Video card: thumbnail, title, recording date, status badge, click navigates to /videos/{id}\n- `frontend/src/components/library/VideoList.tsx` - Filterable/sortable video list container with filter controls\n- `frontend/src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx` - Search input with submit button, Enter key submits\n- `frontend/src/components/search/SearchResults.tsx` - Search results list: each result shows video title, text snippet, timestamp link, speaker label\n- `frontend/src/components/common/Layout.tsx` - Page layout wrapper with navigation\n- `frontend/src/components/common/Navigation.tsx` - Top navigation bar with links: Library, Upload, Search\n- `frontend/src/api/search.ts` - Search API client (searchVideos(query) → SearchResponse)\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Import and use LibraryPage, SearchPage, Layout/Navigation\n- `frontend/src/api/videos.ts` - Add getVideos(filters?) function\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature: Project Scaffolding \u0026 Infrastructure (w-6nz) must be complete\n- Feature: Video Upload \u0026 Storage (w-a4r) must be complete (GET /videos endpoint exists)\n- Feature: Search \u0026 Indexing (w-q64) must be complete (GET /search endpoint exists)\n- Feature: Video Playback \u0026 Transcript UI (w-7bx) should be complete (navigation to /videos/{id}?t= works)\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Library is the home page (route: / or /library)\n- Video cards show thumbnail, title, recording_date, status badge, participant count\n- Filter by status: All, Ready, Processing, Error (dropdown or tabs)\n- Sort options: Date (newest first default), Title (alphabetical)\n- Search results show: video_title, text snippet (highlighted match), timestamp link, speaker label, relevance score\n- Search result timestamp links navigate to /videos/{id}?t={start_time}\n- Empty library shows helpful \"Upload your first video\" message\n- No-results search shows \"No results found\" with suggestion to try different terms\n- Pagination: simple limit/offset for library (initially load all, add pagination if \u003e20 videos)\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- LibraryPage: fetch videos on mount with useEffect, display as grid of VideoCards\n- Filter implementation: client-side filtering for Phase 1 (small dataset), or pass query params to GET /videos\n- GET /videos supports query params: ?status=ready\u0026sort=recording_date\u0026order=desc\u0026limit=20\u0026offset=0\n- VideoCard: onClick navigates to /videos/{id} using react-router-dom's useNavigate\n- SearchPage: manage query state, loading state, results state\n- SearchBar: controlled input, onSubmit calls searchVideos(query)\n- SearchResults: map over results, render each with TimestampLink component (from Feature 5)\n- Navigation: highlight current route (Library, Upload, Search)\n- Use data-testid attributes matching the test specification for Playwright testing\n- Tailwind CSS for styling: responsive grid, status badge colors, hover effects\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: M1 (Video Library View), S1 (frontend tests), S3 (frontend tests)\n\n### Frontend Unit Tests\n- M1-F01: test_library_page_renders - LibraryPage loads, video list displayed\n- M1-F02: test_video_card_displays_metadata - VideoCard shows title, date, status\n- M1-F03: test_filter_controls_present - Status filter dropdown/tabs present\n- M1-F04: test_sort_controls_present - Sort by date option available\n- M1-F05: test_thumbnail_displayed - \u003cimg\u003e with thumbnail src rendered\n- S1-F01: test_search_bar_renders - SearchBar input field present\n- S1-F02: test_search_submits_query - Enter key submits, API called with query\n- S1-F03: test_search_loading_state - Loading spinner during search\n- S3-F01: test_search_result_shows_timestamp - \"at 1:23\" visible in result\n- S3-F02: test_search_result_link_navigates - Click navigates to /videos/{id}?t=\n\n### Integration Tests (Backend - covered in Features 2 and 4)\n- M1-I01: test_list_videos_returns_all - GET /videos returns all videos\n- M1-I02: test_list_videos_pagination - limit/offset params work\n- M1-I03: test_list_videos_filter_by_status - ?status=ready filters correctly\n- M1-I04: test_list_videos_sort_by_date - ?sort=recording_date orders correctly\n\n### E2E Scenarios\n- E2E-01 (steps 7-12): Full search flow - navigate to search, enter query, verify results, click timestamp, verify player\n- E2E-03: Library filtering - all videos visible, filter by ready, sort by date, verify processing indicator\n- E2E-04: Search no results - search nonsense term, verify no-results message\n\n### Quality Gate\nThis feature is NOT complete until:\n- All M1 frontend tests pass (M1-F01 through M1-F05)\n- All S1 frontend tests pass (S1-F01 through S1-F03)\n- All S3 frontend tests pass (S3-F01, S3-F02)\n- Library page shows video cards with correct metadata\n- Filter and sort controls work\n- Search page submits queries and displays results\n- Search results show timestamps that navigate to video player\n- Navigation between pages works (Library, Upload, Search)\n\n## Reference Documentation\n- docs/implementation/phase1.md -

{"id":"w-wqm","title":"Search \u0026 Indexing","description":"# Feature: Search \u0026 Indexing\n\n## Overview\nImplement the OpenSearch indexing and hybrid search (BM25 + vector/kNN) backend. This includes creating the OpenSearch index with proper mappings, the indexing service that bulk-indexes segments with embeddings, and the search API that accepts natural language queries, generates query embeddings, constructs hybrid queries, and returns ranked results with video IDs and timestamps.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- S1: Natural language search (hybrid: BM25 + vector)\n- S3 (backend): Search results include video_id and timestamps\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/services/search.py` - Search service: create_index(), index_segments(segments), hybrid_search(query, limit) → ranked results with video_id, start_time, end_time, text, speaker, score\n- `backend/app/api/routes/search.py` - GET /api/search?q=...\u0026limit=10 → search results\n- `backend/app/schemas/search.py` - SearchQuery, SearchResult, SearchResponse Pydantic schemas\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_search.py` - Search query construction, result ranking tests\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_search_api.py` - Search API integration tests\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/main.py` - Register search routes\n- `backend/app/api/routes/__init__.py` - Export search router\n- `backend/app/core/opensearch.py` - May need index management helpers\n- `backend/app/tasks/indexing.py` - Wire up to search service for bulk indexing\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature 1 (Scaffolding): OpenSearch client, config\n- Feature 3 (Pipeline): Embedding service, segments with embeddings exist in DB\n- External: opensearch-py, sentence-transformers (for query embedding)\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- OpenSearch index name: \"segments\" (or configurable via settings)\n- Index mapping: text (english analyzer), embedding (knn_vector 768-dim, HNSW, cosine), video_id, video_title, transcript_id, start_time, end_time, speaker, recording_date, created_at\n- KNN enabled on index: settings.index.knn = true\n- Hybrid search combines BM25 text match + kNN vector similarity\n- Query embedding generated at search time using same BGE model as indexing\n- Results ranked by combined score (Reciprocal Rank Fusion or weighted combination)\n- Empty query returns empty results (not error)\n- Search results include: video_id, video_title, text, start_time, end_time, speaker, score\n- Limit/offset pagination support\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- OpenSearch index creation should be idempotent (check if exists first)\n- Use opensearch-py bulk API for indexing segments\n- Hybrid query structure: use OpenSearch \"bool\" query with \"should\" clauses for BM25 + script_score for kNN\n- Alternatively, use OpenSearch native hybrid search if available in 2.11\n- Query embedding: use same embedding.generate_embedding() from embedding service\n- BM25 query: match on \"text\" field with english analyzer\n- kNN query: cosinesimil on \"embedding\" field\n- Result deduplication: if same segment appears in both BM25 and kNN results, take highest score\n- Add video_title to indexed document for display in search results\n- For testing: create test index with known documents, verify query returns expected results\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: S1: Natural Language Search, S3: Timestamp Links in Results, C1 (partial - indexing)\n\n### Unit Tests\n- S1-U01: test_embedding_generation - BGE model generates 768-dim vector\n- S1-U02: test_hybrid_query_construction - BM25 + kNN query both present\n- S1-U03: test_search_result_ranking - Results sorted by score (highest first)\n- S1-U04: test_empty_query_handled - Empty string returns empty results\n\n### Integration Tests\n- S1-I01: test_search_finds_keyword_match - Query keyword returns matching segment\n- S1-I02: test_search_finds_semantic_match - Semantic query returns relevant segment\n- S1-I03: test_search_no_results - Nonsense query returns empty results\n- S1-I04: test_search_across_videos - Results from multiple indexed videos\n- S1-I05: test_opensearch_index_mapping - Index has correct schema (kNN enabled, 768-dim, english analyzer)\n- S3-I01: test_search_results_include_timestamps - start_time float present in results\n- S3-I02: test_search_results_include_video_id - video_id UUID present in results\n- C1-I02: test_chunks_indexed_to_opensearch - OpenSearch doc count matches DB segment count\n\n### E2E Scenarios\n- E2E-01 (steps 7-9): Search for key term, verify result found\n- E2E-04: Search with no results, verify empty handling\n\n### Quality Gate\nThis feature is NOT complete until:\n- All S1-U*, S1-I*, S3-I* tests pass\n- Hybrid search returns relevant results for both keyword and semantic queries\n- Index mapping correct with kNN enabled\n- Empty/nonsense queries handled gracefully\n- Search results include video_id, start_time, text, speaker\n\n## Reference Documentation\n- docs/design/data-model.md -

{"id":"w-zqu","title":"Video Upload \u0026 Storage","description":"# Feature: Video Upload \u0026 Storage\n\n## Overview\nImplement the video upload flow end-to-end: backend API endpoint for receiving MKV files with metadata, file storage to disk, database record creation, Celery task dispatch, and the frontend upload form with progress indication. This is the entry point for all video content in the system.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- V1: Upload MKV with metadata (title, date, participants, notes)\n- V3 (partial): Initial status set to \"uploaded\", status endpoint\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/api/routes/videos.py` - POST /api/videos (multipart upload), GET /api/videos/{id}, GET /api/videos/{id}/status\n- `backend/app/services/video.py` - Video CRUD: create_video (save file, create DB record, queue task), get_video, get_video_status\n- `frontend/src/pages/UploadPage.tsx` - Upload page with form and progress\n- `frontend/src/components/upload/UploadForm.tsx` - Form fields: file input (.mkv only), title, date, participants (comma-separated), context notes\n- `frontend/src/components/upload/UploadProgress.tsx` - Upload progress bar using axios onUploadProgress\n- `frontend/src/api/videos.ts` - API client: uploadVideo(), getVideo(), getVideoStatus()\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_video_schema.py` - Schema validation tests\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_video_api.py` - Upload API integration tests\n- `frontend/src/__tests__/components/UploadForm.test.tsx` - Frontend upload tests\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/main.py` - Register video routes\n- `backend/app/api/routes/__init__.py` - Export video router\n- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Wire up UploadPage route\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature 1 (Project Scaffolding) must be complete - provides models, DB, config, Docker\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- File upload via multipart/form-data (python-multipart)\n- Files saved to /data/videos/original/{uuid}.mkv\n- Participants parsed from comma-separated string to TEXT[] array\n- Upload endpoint returns video ID immediately, processing is async\n- File extension validation: only .mkv accepted (400 for others)\n- Title and recording_date are required fields (422 for missing)\n- After DB record creation, dispatch Celery task for processing (video_processing.delay(video_id))\n- Status endpoint supports polling from frontend\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Upload endpoint must handle large files (streaming to disk, not memory)\n- Use UploadFile from FastAPI for file handling\n- Save file with UUID-based filename to avoid conflicts: {video_id}.mkv\n- Frontend UploadForm uses controlled inputs with React state\n- Progress bar uses axios upload progress callback\n- After successful upload, redirect to library or show success message\n- Participants field: split on comma, trim whitespace, store as array\n- data-testid attributes on form elements for E2E testing: upload-form, file-input, title-input, date-input, participants-input, submit-btn, progress-bar, success-message\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: V1: Video Upload, V3: Processing Status (partial)\n\n### Unit Tests\n- V1-U01: test_video_schema_validation - Valid data passes, invalid rejected\n- V1-U02: test_video_file_extension_validation - Only .mkv accepted, non-MKV gets 400\n- V1-U03: test_video_metadata_required_fields - Missing title/date returns 422\n- V1-U04: test_participants_array_parsing - \"Alice, Bob\" stored as [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]\n- V3-U01: test_status_enum_values - All expected status values defined\n\n### Integration Tests\n- V1-I01: test_upload_creates_video_record - POST /api/videos creates DB record with status=uploaded\n- V1-I02: test_upload_stores_file - File saved to /data/videos/original/\n- V1-I03: test_upload_triggers_processing_task - Celery task queued (mock Celery)\n- V1-I04: test_upload_returns_video_id - Response includes valid UUID\n- V3-I02: test_status_endpoint_returns_current - GET /api/videos/{id}/status returns status\n\n### Frontend Unit Tests\n- V1-F01: test_upload_form_renders - All fields visible\n- V1-F02: test_upload_form_validation - Error shown for missing title\n- V1-F03: test_file_type_restriction - File input accepts .mkv only\n- V1-F04: test_upload_progress_display - Progress bar updates\n\n### E2E Scenarios\n- E2E-01 (steps 1-5): Upload form, fill metadata, submit, observe progress\n- E2E-05: Upload corrupted video, observe error handling\n\n### Quality Gate\nThis feature is NOT complete until:\n- All V1-U*, V1-I*, V1-F* tests pass\n- V3-I02 (status endpoint) passes\n- Upload flow works manually via curl and via frontend\n- File lands on disk and DB record is created\n\n## Reference Documentation\n- docs/design/data-model.md - Video table schema\n- docs/design/processing-pipeline.md - Upload trigger flow\n- docs/implementation/phase1.md - API endpoints, project structure\n- docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md - V1, V3 test specs","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-07T13:54:35.763931975+02:00","updated_at":"2026-02-07T14:15:16.595814328+02:00","close_reason":"Starting fresh -
