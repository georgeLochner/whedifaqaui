Users can watch processed videos, see the transcript highlighted in sync with playback, click transcript segments to seek the video, and share deep links to specific timestamps via URL parameters.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- P1: Embedded video player with standard controls\n- P2: Timestamp navigation (clickable timestamps, URL deep-linking)\n- P3: Synchronized transcript display (current segment highlighted, click to seek)\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/api/routes/playback.py` - GET /videos/{id}/stream (video file serving with Range request support), GET /videos/{id}/transcript (transcript segments with timestamps and speakers)\n- `backend/app/schemas/transcript.py` - TranscriptResponse, SegmentResponse Pydantic schemas\n- `frontend/src/pages/VideoPage.tsx` - Video playback page: player + transcript panel side-by-side, URL timestamp parameter handling (?t=seconds)\n- `frontend/src/components/video/VideoPlayer.tsx` - HTML5 video player using Video.js with standard controls (play, pause, seek, volume), src pointing to /videos/{id}/stream\n- `frontend/src/components/video/TranscriptPanel.tsx` - Scrollable transcript with segments, current segment highlighted, click to seek, speaker labels, auto-scroll during playback\n- `frontend/src/components/video/TimestampLink.tsx` - Clickable timestamp component (formats seconds to MM:SS, onClick seeks player)\n- `frontend/src/hooks/useVideoPlayer.ts` - Custom hook for player state management (currentTime, playing, seek function)\n- `frontend/src/hooks/useTranscriptSync.ts` - Custom hook for transcript synchronization (determines active segment based on currentTime)\n- `frontend/src/types/transcript.ts` - Transcript and Segment TypeScript types\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_playback_api.py` - Playback API tests\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/main.py` - Mount playback router\n- `backend/app/api/routes/__init__.py` - Export playback router\n- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Import and use VideoPage component\n- `frontend/src/api/videos.ts` - Add getTranscript() API function\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature: Project Scaffolding \u0026 Infrastructure (w-6nz) must be complete\n- Feature: Video Upload \u0026 Storage (w-a4r) must be complete (video records exist)\n- Feature: Video Processing Pipeline (w-csa) must be complete (MP4 transcoded, transcript generated)\n- Video.js 8.6.x for the player component\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Video served as MP4 from /data/videos/processed/{id}.mp4 via streaming endpoint\n- Range request support (HTTP 206) for seek functionality\n- Transcript endpoint returns array of segments with: id, start_time, end_time, text, speaker\n- Timestamp format: seconds displayed as MM:SS (e.g., 125s → \"2:05\")\n- URL deep-linking: /videos/{id}?t=125 auto-seeks to 2:05 on page load\n- Transcript auto-scrolls to keep active segment visible during playback\n- Active segment determined by: segment.start_time \u003c= currentTime \u003c segment.end_time\n- Video.js player wrapped in React component with ref for programmatic control\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Stream endpoint: use FileResponse or StreamingResponse with media_type=\"video/mp4\"\n- Support Range headers for partial content (HTTP 206) - critical for seek\n- Transcript endpoint queries segments table ordered by start_time\n- VideoPlayer component: initialize Video.js on mount, destroy on unmount\n- TranscriptPanel: listen to player timeupdate events, find active segment, apply 'active' CSS class\n- TimestampLink: format seconds with Math.floor(s/60) + \":\" + pad(s%60)\n- URL timestamp: read ?t= from useSearchParams, seek player on mount\n- When user clicks transcript segment, call player.currentTime(segment.start_time)\n- Speaker labels displayed as \"SPEAKER_00:\" prefix on each segment\n- Use data-testid attributes for Playwright testing (see test spec for exact IDs)\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: P1 (Embedded Video Player), P2 (Timestamp Navigation), P3 (Synchronized Transcript)\n\n### Unit Tests (Backend)\n- P1-U01: test_video_transcode_to_mp4 -

{"id":"w-csa","title":"Video Processing Pipeline","description":"# Feature: Video Processing Pipeline\n\n## Overview\nImplement the async processing pipeline that transforms uploaded MKV videos into searchable, playable content. This includes FFmpeg transcoding (MKV→MP4), audio extraction, thumbnail generation, WhisperX transcription with speaker diarization, semantic chunking with embeddings, and status updates throughout. The pipeline runs as a chain of Celery tasks.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- V2: Automatic transcription with timestamps and speaker diarization\n- V3: Processing status indicators (pipeline-side: status transitions during processing)\n- C1: Semantic chunking (transcript segmented into semantic chunks for indexing)\n- P1: Embedded video player (prerequisite: MP4 transcoding)\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/services/ffmpeg.py` - FFmpeg operations: remux/transcode MKV→MP4, extract audio WAV, generate thumbnail\n- `backend/app/services/transcription.py` - WhisperX integration: model loading, transcription + speaker diarization, output parsing\n- `backend/app/services/chunking.py` - Semantic chunking: embedding-based boundary detection, chunk creation with speaker labels\n- `backend/app/services/embedding.py` - BGE model wrapper (BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5): batch embedding generation, 768-dim vectors\n- `backend/app/tasks/video_processing.py` - Celery task: FFmpeg remux/transcode, thumbnail, audio extraction; updates status to 'processing'\n- `backend/app/tasks/transcription.py` - Celery task: WhisperX transcription + diarization → JSON output, creates transcript + initial segments in DB; updates status to 'transcribing'\n- `backend/app/tasks/chunking.py` - Celery task: semantic chunking → segments in DB with speaker labels; updates status to 'chunking'\n- `backend/app/tasks/indexing.py` - Celery task: generate embeddings, bulk index segments to OpenSearch; updates status to 'indexing' then 'ready'\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_transcription.py` - WhisperX output parsing tests\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_chunking.py` - Semantic chunking logic tests\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_embedding.py` - Embedding generation tests\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_processing_pipeline.py` - Full pipeline integration tests\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/tasks/celery_app.py` - Register all task modules\n- `backend/app/services/video.py` - Add status update methods\n- `backend/app/api/routes/videos.py` - Ensure upload endpoint dispatches the processing chain\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature: Project Scaffolding \u0026 Infrastructure (w-6nz) must be complete\n- Feature: Video Upload \u0026 Storage (w-a4r) must be complete (upload creates DB record)\n- FFmpeg installed in Docker container\n- WhisperX + pyannote.audio for transcription/diarization\n- sentence-transformers for BGE embeddings\n- HuggingFace token for pyannote models (env var)\n- CUDA optional but recommended for performance\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Pipeline stages chained as Celery tasks: video_processing → transcription → chunking → indexing\n- Each stage updates video status in PostgreSQL (processing → transcribing → chunking → indexing → ready)\n- On any error, status set to 'error' with error_message populated\n- WhisperX provides both transcription AND speaker labels (SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc.)\n- Transcript JSON saved to /data/transcripts/{video_id}.json for LLM verification\n- Semantic chunking uses embedding cosine similarity to detect topic boundaries\n- Chunking parameters from system_settings: similarity_threshold=0.5, min_chunk_tokens=100, max_chunk_tokens=500\n- BGE model: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5, 768-dimensional embeddings\n- OpenSearch indexing: bulk API with segment text, embedding, metadata\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- FFmpeg remux: if source is MKV with H.264+AAC, remux to MP4 (fast copy). Otherwise, transcode.\n- Audio extraction: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 output.wav\n- Thumbnail: extract frame at 10% of duration, resize to 320x180\n- WhisperX workflow: load model → transcribe → align → diarize → merge segments\n- Speaker labels format: \"SPEAKER_00\", \"SPEAKER_01\", etc. from pyannote\n- Transcript saved as JSON with segments[{start, end, text, speaker}]\n- Semantic chunking algorithm:\n  1.

This is the primary video consumption interface where users watch videos and follow along with transcripts.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- P1: Embedded video player with standard controls\n- P2: Timestamp navigation (clickable timestamps, URL deep-linking)\n- P3: Synchronized transcript display with speaker labels\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/api/routes/playback.py` - GET /api/videos/{id}/stream (video file with range request support), GET /api/videos/{id}/transcript (transcript segments as JSON)\n- `frontend/src/pages/VideoPage.tsx` - Video page layout: player + transcript panel side-by-side\n- `frontend/src/components/video/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Video.js player component, plays from /api/videos/{id}/stream, supports seeking via prop\n- `frontend/src/components/video/TranscriptPanel.tsx` - Scrollable transcript: list of segments with speaker labels, highlights active segment, click to seek, auto-scrolls\n- `frontend/src/components/video/TimestampLink.tsx` - Clickable timestamp component: displays formatted time (MM:SS), onClick seeks video or navigates to /videos/{id}?t=seconds\n- `frontend/src/hooks/useVideoPlayer.ts` - Custom hook: manages player ref, currentTime state, seek function, handles ?t= URL parameter on mount\n- `frontend/src/hooks/useTranscriptSync.ts` - Custom hook: given currentTime and segments, returns activeSegmentIndex\n- `frontend/src/types/transcript.ts` - Transcript and Segment TypeScript types\n- `frontend/src/api/videos.ts` - (extend) getTranscript(videoId) API call\n- `frontend/src/__tests__/components/VideoPlayer.test.tsx` -

{"id":"w-pi2","title":"Video Processing Pipeline","description":"# Feature: Video Processing Pipeline\n\n## Overview\nImplement the async Celery pipeline that processes uploaded videos through four stages: FFmpeg transcode (MKV→MP4 + audio extraction + thumbnail), WhisperX transcription with speaker diarization, semantic chunking with embeddings, and status tracking through each stage. This is the core backend intelligence that transforms raw video into searchable content.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- V2: Automatic transcription with timestamps and speaker diarization\n- V3: Processing status indicators (status transitions through pipeline)\n- C1: Semantic chunking for search indexing\n- P1 (partial): FFmpeg transcode to MP4 for browser playback\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/services/ffmpeg.py` - FFmpeg operations: remux_to_mp4(input, output), extract_audio(input, output_wav), generate_thumbnail(input, output, timestamp=5)\n- `backend/app/services/transcription.py` - WhisperX integration: load_model(), transcribe(audio_path) → {segments with speaker labels, language, word_count}\n- `backend/app/services/chunking.py` - Semantic chunking: chunk_transcript(segments) → chunks with start/end times, text, speaker, using embedding similarity for boundary detection\n- `backend/app/services/embedding.py` - BGE model wrapper: load_model(), generate_embedding(text) → 768-dim vector, batch_embed(texts) → list of vectors\n- `backend/app/tasks/video_processing.py` - Celery task: remux/transcode MKV→MP4, extract audio WAV, generate thumbnail, update status to \"processing\"→\"transcribing\"\n- `backend/app/tasks/transcription.py` - Celery task: run WhisperX on audio, save transcript record, save WhisperX JSON to /data/transcripts/{video_id}.json, create segments in DB, update status to \"transcribing\"→\"chunking\"\n- `backend/app/tasks/chunking.py` - Celery task: read raw segments, apply semantic chunking, generate embeddings, save chunked segments to DB, update status to \"chunking\"→\"indexing\"\n- `backend/app/tasks/indexing.py` - Celery task: read segments from DB, bulk index to OpenSearch with embeddings, update status to \"indexing\"→\"ready\"\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_transcription.py` - WhisperX output parsing tests\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_chunking.py` - Semantic chunking logic tests\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_embedding.py` - Embedding generation tests\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_processing_pipeline.py` - Full pipeline integration tests\n- `scripts/prepare-test-data.sh` - Test data preparation script (download YouTube video, create test files)\n- `scripts/convert_srt_to_ground_truth.py` - SRT to ground truth JSON converter\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/tasks/celery_app.py` - Register task modules\n- `backend/app/models/video.py` - May need status transition helper method\n- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Add WHISPER_MODEL, WHISPER_DEVICE, HF_TOKEN settings\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature 1 (Scaffolding): Models, DB, Celery config\n- Feature 2 (Upload): Video records exist in DB, upload triggers pipeline\n- External: FFmpeg (system package), WhisperX (pip), pyannote.audio (pip + HuggingFace token), sentence-transformers (pip)\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Pipeline is a Celery chain: video_processing → transcription → chunking → indexing\n- Each task updates video status before starting its work\n- Error handling: if any task fails, set status to \"error\" with error_message\n- WhisperX provides both transcription AND speaker diarization (SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc.)\n- Semantic chunking uses embedding cosine similarity to detect topic boundaries (not fixed size)\n- Chunk size target: 50-500 words\n- Chunks split at sentence boundaries\n- Each chunk preserves speaker attribution\n- Embeddings use BGE model (BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) producing 768-dim vectors\n- Audio extracted as WAV temporarily, deleted after transcription\n- WhisperX JSON output saved to /data/transcripts/{video_id}.json for LLM verification\n- Thumbnail generated at 5-second mark of video\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Use ffmpeg-python library for FFmpeg operations\n- WhisperX API: whisperx.load_model(model, device), model.transcribe(audio), whisperx.load_align_model(), whisperx.align(), whisperx.DiarizationPipeline(), diarize_model(audio)\n- Semantic chunking algorithm: compute embeddings for each raw segment, calculate cosine similarity between consecutive segments, split where similarity drops below threshold\n- Tasks should be idempotent where possible (re-runnable on failure)\n- Status transitions must be atomic (use DB transaction)\n- Processing status flow: uploaded → processing → transcribing → chunking → indexing → ready\n- On error: status → error, error_message populated with descriptive text (not stack trace)\n- Celery task chaining: video_processing.s(video_id) | transcription.s() | chunking.s() | indexing.s()\n- For testing: mock WhisperX with deterministic output, test actual FFmpeg with small test video\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: V2: Automatic Transcription, V3: Processing Status, C1: Semantic Chunking\n\n### Unit Tests\n- V2-U01: test_whisperx_output_parsing -

Error captured with descriptive message\n- C1-I01: test_chunking_creates_segments - Segments stored in DB\n- C1-I03: test_chunk_embeddings_generated - 768-dim vector per segment\n\n### E2E Tests (LLM-verified)\n- V2-E01: test_transcription_content_accuracy - Content accuracy ≥85% vs ground truth\n- V2-E02: test_speaker_diarization - Speaker count matches, transitions reasonable\n- V2-E03: test_timestamp_alignment - Boundaries within ±2s\n- V2-E04: test_key_terms_preserved - ≥90% key terms found\n- V2-E05: test_overall_transcription_quality - Weighted score ≥80%\n\n### E2E Scenarios\n- E2E-01 (steps 5-6): Wait for processing, LLM verification\n- E2E-05: Corrupted video error handling\n- E2E-06: Multi-speaker diarization with test_meeting_long.mkv\n- E2E-07: LLM transcript verification\n\n### Quality Gate\nThis feature is NOT complete until:\n- All V2-*, V3-*, C1-*, P1-U01/U02 tests pass\n- Full pipeline runs on test video: upload → processing → transcribing → chunking → ready\n- WhisperX produces segments with speaker labels\n- Semantic chunking produces reasonably sized chunks\n- Status transitions tracked correctly\n- Error handling works for corrupted video\n\n## Reference Documentation\n- docs/design/processing-pipeline.md -

{"id":"w-q64","title":"Search \u0026 Indexing","description":"# Feature: Search \u0026 Indexing\n\n## Overview\nImplement the hybrid search system that enables natural language queries across all indexed video transcripts. This includes the OpenSearch index setup, hybrid query construction (BM25 keyword + kNN vector similarity), search API endpoint, and search result ranking. Users can search with free-text queries and get results with video references, timestamps, and text snippets.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- S1: Natural language search (hybrid: BM25 + vector)\n- S3: Search results link directly to video timestamps (backend: results include video_id, start_time)\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/services/search.py` - OpenSearch hybrid query builder: BM25 text search + kNN vector search, Reciprocal Rank Fusion for combining scores, result formatting\n- `backend/app/schemas/search.py` - SearchRequest (query string, optional filters), SearchResponse (results with video_id, video_title, text, start_time, end_time, speaker, score)\n- `backend/app/api/routes/search.py` - GET /search?q=... endpoint with query parameter, returns ranked search results\n- `backend/tests/unit/test_search.py` - Query construction and result ranking tests\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_search_api.py` - Search API integration tests\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/main.py` - Mount search router\n- `backend/app/api/routes/__init__.py` - Export search router\n- `backend/app/core/opensearch.py` - Add index creation/management methods, ensure segments_index exists with correct mapping\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature: Project Scaffolding \u0026 Infrastructure (w-6nz) must be complete\n- Feature: Video Processing Pipeline (w-csa) must be complete (provides indexed segments)\n- OpenSearch 2.11.1 with kNN plugin enabled\n- sentence-transformers for query embedding generation (reuses embedding service)\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Hybrid search: combine BM25 (keyword) and kNN (semantic) results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)\n- Query embedding uses same BGE model (BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) as indexing\n- Default results: top 10 segments, sorted by combined RRF score\n- Search results include: video_id, video_title, text snippet, start_time, end_time, speaker, relevance score\n- OpenSearch segments_index uses English analyzer for text field, HNSW for kNN vectors\n- Empty query returns error or empty results (not all documents)\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- OpenSearch hybrid query structure:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"query\": {\n      \"bool\": {\n        \"should\": [\n          {\"match\": {\"text\": {\"query\": \"user query\", \"boost\": 1.0}}},\n          {\"knn\": {\"embedding\": {\"vector\": [query_embedding], \"k\": 10}}}\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- Generate query embedding at search time using the embedding service\n- RRF formula: score = sum(1 / (k + rank_i)) where k=60 (standard constant)\n- Search results include video_title joined from the indexed document\n- Handle edge cases: empty query, no results, OpenSearch connection errors\n- Index mapping must have knn=true in settings\n- Segment fields indexed: id, video_id, video_title, transcript_id, text, embedding (768-dim), start_time, end_time, speaker, recording_date, created_at\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: S1 (Natural Language Search), S3 (Timestamp Links in Results)\n\n### Unit Tests\n- S1-U01: test_embedding_generation - BGE model generates 768-dim vector\n- S1-U02: test_hybrid_query_construction - Both BM25 and kNN clauses present in query\n- S1-U03: test_search_result_ranking - Results sorted by score descending\n- S1-U04: test_empty_query_handled - Empty string returns empty or error\n\n### Integration Tests\n- S1-I01: test_search_finds_keyword_match - Query with known keyword returns matching segment\n- S1-I02: test_search_finds_semantic_match - Conceptual query returns semantically relevant segment\n- S1-I03: test_search_no_results - Query \"nonexistent xyz\" returns empty results\n- S1-I04: test_search_across_videos - Multi-video search returns results from multiple videos\n- S1-I05: test_opensearch_index_mapping - Index has kNN enabled, 768-dim vector field, english analyzer\n- S3-I01: test_search_results_include_timestamps - start_time float value present in results\n- S3-I02: test_search_results_include_video_id - video_id UUID present in results\n\n### E2E Scenarios\n- E2E-01 (steps 7-9): Search for key term, verify result shows video with timestamp\n- E2E-04: Search with no results - \"nonexistent term xyz123\" shows no results message\n\n### Quality Gate\nThis feature is NOT complete until:\n- All S1 unit tests pass (S1-U01 through S1-U04)\n- All S1 integration tests pass (S1-I01 through S1-I05)\n- All S3 integration tests pass (S3-I01, S3-I02)\n- Search finds content from the test video after processing\n- Hybrid search returns both keyword and semantic matches\n- Search results include video_id, start_time, text, score\n\n## Reference Documentation\n- docs/design/data-model.md -

This includes creating the OpenSearch index with proper mappings, the indexing service that bulk-indexes segments with embeddings, and the search API that accepts natural language queries, generates query embeddings, constructs hybrid queries, and returns ranked results with video IDs and timestamps.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- S1: Natural language search (hybrid: BM25 + vector)\n- S3 (backend): Search results include video_id and timestamps\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/services/search.py` - Search service: create_index(), index_segments(segments), hybrid_search(query, limit) → ranked results with video_id, start_time, end_time, text, speaker, score\n- `backend/app/api/routes/search.py` -

Filterable/sortable video list container\n- `frontend/src/components/common/StatusBadge.tsx` - Status badge component with color coding: ready=green, processing/transcribing/chunking/indexing=yellow, error=red, uploaded=gray\n- `frontend/src/components/common/Layout.tsx` - Page layout with navigation header\n- `frontend/src/components/common/Navigation.tsx` - Navigation bar: Library, Upload, Search links\n- `frontend/src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx` - Search input with submit on Enter, loading state\n- `frontend/src/components/search/SearchResults.tsx` - Results list: video title, text snippet, timestamp link, speaker label\n- `frontend/src/api/search.ts` - API client: searchVideos(query, limit, offset) → SearchResponse\n- `frontend/src/__tests__/components/VideoCard.test.tsx` - Card rendering tests\n- `frontend/src/__tests__/pages/LibraryPage.test.tsx` - Library page tests\n- `frontend/src/__tests__/pages/SearchPage.test.tsx` - Search page tests\n- `frontend/src/__tests__/components/SearchBar.test.tsx` - Search bar tests\n- `backend/tests/integration/test_video_api.py` - (extend) List videos API tests\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/app/api/routes/videos.py` - Add GET /api/videos with query params: status, sort, limit, offset\n- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Wire up LibraryPage at / and /library, SearchPage at /search\n- `frontend/src/api/videos.ts` - Add listVideos(params) API call\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature 1 (Scaffolding): Base app, routing, types\n- Feature 2 (Upload): Video records in DB\n- Feature 4 (Search): Search API backend endpoint\n- Feature 5 (Playback): VideoPage for navigation targets, TimestampLink component\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Library page is the home page (route: / and /library)\n- Video cards show thumbnail (or placeholder), title, recording_date, status badge, participant count\n- Filter by status: dropdown with \"All\", \"Ready\", \"Processing\", \"Error\"\n- Sort by: recording_date (default desc), title, created_at\n- Pagination: load more button or infinite scroll (simple offset-based)\n- Status badge colors: ready=green, processing/transcribing/chunking/indexing=yellow/amber, error=red, uploaded=gray\n- Search page: centered search bar, results below\n- Search results show: video title, text snippet (highlighted match), timestamp (formatted as MM:SS), speaker label\n- Clicking result timestamp navigates to /videos/{id}?t={start_time}\n- Empty search shows prompt text (\"Search across your video library...\")\n- No results shows friendly message\n- Loading state shows spinner\n- Navigation: always visible header with links to Library, Upload, Search\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- GET /api/videos query params: ?status=ready\u0026sort=recording_date\u0026order=desc\u0026limit=20\u0026offset=0\n- Backend uses SQLAlchemy query with optional filters and ordering\n- Frontend uses axios to call list/search APIs\n- VideoCard links to /videos/{id}\n- StatusBadge uses Tailwind classes for colors (bg-green-100 text-green-800, etc.)\n- SearchResults map over results, render TimestampLink for each\n- Use react-router-dom Link for navigation\n- Layout component wraps all pages with Navigation\n- data-testid attributes: library-page, video-card, status-badge-{status}, library-empty, search-input, search-loading, search-result, no-results, filter-status, sort-control\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: M1: Video Library View, S1 (frontend), S3 (frontend), V3 (frontend)\n\n### Integration Tests (Backend)\n- M1-I01: test_list_videos_returns_all - GET /api/videos returns all videos\n- M1-I02: test_list_videos_pagination - limit/offset params work\n- M1-I03: test_list_videos_filter_by_status - ?status=ready filters correctly\n- M1-I04: test_list_videos_sort_by_date - ?sort=recording_date orders correctly\n\n### Frontend Unit Tests\n- M1-F01: test_library_page_renders - Video list displayed\n- M1-F02: test_video_card_displays_metadata - Title, date, status visible on card\n- M1-F03: test_filter_controls_present -

{"id":"w-zqu","title":"Video Upload \u0026 Storage","description":"# Feature: Video Upload \u0026 Storage\n\n## Overview\nImplement the video upload flow end-to-end: backend API endpoint for receiving MKV files with metadata, file storage to disk, database record creation, Celery task dispatch, and the frontend upload form with progress indication. This is the entry point for all video content in the system.\n\n## User Stories Covered\n- V1: Upload MKV with metadata (title, date, participants, notes)\n- V3 (partial): Initial status set to \"uploaded\", status endpoint\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Files to Create\n- `backend/app/api/routes/videos.py` - POST /api/videos (multipart upload), GET /api/videos/{id}, GET /api/videos/{id}/status\n- `backend/app/services/video.py` - Video CRUD: create_video (save file, create DB record, queue task), get_video, get_video_status\n- `frontend/src/pages/UploadPage.tsx` -

Export video router\n- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Wire up UploadPage route\n\n### Dependencies\n- Feature 1 (Project Scaffolding) must be complete - provides models, DB, config, Docker\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- File upload via multipart/form-data (python-multipart)\n- Files saved to /data/videos/original/{uuid}.mkv\n- Participants parsed from comma-separated string to TEXT[] array\n- Upload endpoint returns video ID immediately, processing is async\n- File extension validation: only .mkv accepted (400 for others)\n- Title and recording_date are required fields (422 for missing)\n- After DB record creation, dispatch Celery task for processing (video_processing.delay(video_id))\n- Status endpoint supports polling from frontend\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Upload endpoint must handle large files (streaming to disk, not memory)\n- Use UploadFile from FastAPI for file handling\n- Save file with UUID-based filename to avoid conflicts: {video_id}.mkv\n- Frontend UploadForm uses controlled inputs with React state\n- Progress bar uses axios upload progress callback\n- After successful upload, redirect to library or show success message\n- Participants field: split on comma, trim whitespace, store as array\n- data-testid attributes on form elements for E2E testing: upload-form, file-input, title-input, date-input, participants-input, submit-btn, progress-bar, success-message\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Specification Reference\n- Document: docs/testing/phase1-test-specification.md\n- Sections: V1: Video Upload, V3: Processing Status (partial)\n\n### Unit Tests\n- V1-U01: test_video_schema_validation - Valid data passes, invalid rejected\n- V1-U02: test_video_file_extension_validation - Only .mkv accepted, non-MKV gets 400\n- V1-U03: test_video_metadata_required_fields - Missing title/date returns 422\n- V1-U04: test_participants_array_parsing - \"Alice, Bob\" stored as [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]\n- V3-U01: test_status_enum_values - All expected status values defined\n\n### Integration Tests\n- V1-I01: test_upload_creates_video_record - POST /api/videos creates DB record with status=uploaded\n- V1-I02: test_upload_stores_file - File saved to /data/videos/original/\n- V1-I03: test_upload_triggers_processing_task - Celery task queued (mock Celery)\n- V1-I04: test_upload_returns_video_id - Response includes valid UUID\n- V3-I02: test_status_endpoint_returns_current -
